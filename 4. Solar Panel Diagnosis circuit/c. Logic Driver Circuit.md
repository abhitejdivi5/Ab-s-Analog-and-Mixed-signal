# Logic Driver Circuit (LDC)

With Regards, Abhitej Divi,

The Logic Driver Circuit (LDC) processes the outputs from both the Voltage Sensing Circuit (VSC) and the Current Sensing Circuit (CSC).  
It generates four different logic outputs (A, B, C, D), each representing the solar panelâ€™s operating condition.  

The outputs are based on the combination of high/low values from the VSC and CSC:

| VSC Output | CSC Output | LDC Output | Condition             |
|------------|------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 0          | 0          | A          | Unstable / No fault   |
| 0          | 1          | B          | Short-circuit fault   |
| 1          | 0          | C          | Open-circuit fault    |
| 1          | 1          | D          | Ignore condition      |

## 2. Simulation Results

The transient simulation confirms the correct logic behavior of the LDC. Each combination of VSC and CSC outputs generates the expected fault indicator (A, B, C, or D).
