# 3. Integrated Diagnostic System Circuit

The integrated diagnostic system combines **Voltage & Current Sensing Circuits, Logic Driver, XOR Gate, Memory, and Buffers** 
into one cohesive design working for around 60Mhz.  
- The sensing circuits monitor the SP voltage and current.  
- The logic driver processes and classifies faults.  
- The XOR gate flags discrepancies between open and short-circuit conditions.  
- The memory stores the fault condition.  
- The buffer drives the LED indicator for visible fault detection.
