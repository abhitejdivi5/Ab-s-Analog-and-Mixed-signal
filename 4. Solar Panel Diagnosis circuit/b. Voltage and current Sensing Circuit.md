# Voltage Sensing Comparator (VSC)

The Voltage Sensing Comparator (VSC) is designed to compare the solar panel voltage with a reference voltage (Vref).  
- If the solar panel voltage (Vp) is greater than Vref, the comparator outputs **logic high**.
- If Vp is less than Vref, the comparator outputs **logic low**, indicating that the panel voltage is within the safe range.

This ensures accurate detection of open-circuit or abnormal operating conditions in the solar panel.
