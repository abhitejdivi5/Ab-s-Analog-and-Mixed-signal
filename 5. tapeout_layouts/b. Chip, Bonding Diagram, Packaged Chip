## IC Packaging Process

### 1. Connected Chip (On-Die Layout)
The completed chip layout integrates all circuit blocks, surrounded by I/O pads. This view shows the GDSII export before fabrication.

### 2. Bonding Diagram
The bonding diagram maps internal chip pads to external package pins using bond wires, ensuring correct signal routing.
